### 😀 Hi, there!
👦 I'm Luis, student of Software Engineering and frontend trainee, and also a physics teacher.
👩‍💻 Currently, I'm working hard learning core concepts and tecnologies to get my first job as a software developer 😁, highschool STEM teacher, and amateur astronomer, musician and photographer.

🟢 Some tools that I feel already comfortably familiar with are:
* HTML (and Markdown)
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Visual Studio Code
* Linux terminal

🟡 Some things that I'm still learning to incorporate more deeply into my projects and skills are:
* Git
* TypeScript
* OOP and functional programming

🔴 And the things that I'll soon incorporate into my learning trajectory:
* React
* Tailwind CSS
* Zustand
* Next / Astro

👩‍🏫 As a Physics teacher, I have 5 years of experience and, although I love my job and to inspire my students to build their knowledge everyday, I also try to conquer new challenges and continue learning and growing 🙂

⭐ Some of the accomplishments my students were able to get so far:
🥇 1st place in the "Scientific Rally" (2023)
🥇 1st place in the state contest to select the delegation representatives for the "Olimpiada Mexicana de Física" (2023)
🏅 2 Honorific mentions in the "Olimpiada Morelense de Física" (2023)
🥇 1st place in the state contest to select the delegation representatives for the "Olimpiada Mexicana de Física" (2019)

👀 Some of my other interests and hobbies:
🔭 amateur astronomy
📷 photography
🎵 music, especially piano, traverse flute and guitar
🌱 gardening
🎮 videogames
